# ⚡ cf-blitz

A high-speed Codeforces problem-solving repository — built for blitzing through contests, practicing smart, and tracking progress like a grandmaster in training.

## 🚀 What is `cf-blitz`?

`cf-blitz` is my personal repository for solving and organizing Codeforces problems.  
It’s optimized for:

- 🧠 Improving problem-solving speed  
- 🛠️ Using robust templates (Java/C++ ready)  
- 🎯 Practicing by tags and difficulty  
- 📝 Documenting learnings, mistakes, and edge cases  
- 🧪 Testing solutions locally before submitting  

---

## 🧪 Test Strategy

- Local testing via `stdin` redirection or VS Code snippets  
- Output verification for edge cases  
- Debug logging via `System.err` / `cerr`  

---

## 🧩 Problem Tags

Organized and tagged by:
- Greedy, DP, Binary Search, Graphs, etc.  
- Difficulty level: 800 ➡️ 2500+  

_May the test cases tremble before your logic._

## 🏁 Goals

- [ ] Solve 100+ Codeforces problems by [Your Goal Date]  
- [ ] Maintain accuracy > 90%  
- [ ] Solve a full Div.2 contest within the time limit  
- [ ] Avoid WA on pretest 2 😅  

---

## 📌 Notes

- All solutions are written during practice or virtual contests.  
- Naming conventions follow contest/problem code where possible (e.g., `A_Sum.java`, `B_Bricks.cpp`).  
- Feel free to fork/clone and use the templates.
